@article{Grigore2016,
abstract = {The core challenge in designing an effective static program analysis
                  is to find a good program abstraction -- one that retains only
                  details relevant to a given query. In this paper, we present a
                  new approach for automatically finding such an abstraction.
                  Our approach uses a pessimistic strategy, which can optionally
                  use guidance from a probabilistic model. Our approach applies
                  to parametric static analyses implemented in Datalog, and is
                  based on counterexample-guided abstraction refinement. For
                  each untried abstraction, our probabilistic model provides a
                  probability of success, while the size of the abstraction
                  provides an estimate of its cost in terms of analysis time.
                  Combining these two metrics, probability and cost, our
                  refinement algorithm picks an optimal abstraction. Our
                  probabilistic model is a variant of the Erdos-Renyi random
                  graph model, and it is tunable by what we call
                  hyperparameters. We present a method to learn good values for
                  these hyperparameters, by observing past runs of the analysis
                  on an existing codebase. We evaluate our approach on an object
                  sensitive pointer analysis for Java programs, with two client
                  analyses (PolySite and Downcast).},

abstract = {Probabilistic programming means two strongly connected models as
                  well as the study of their mathematical properties, solutions
                  of the relevant optimization problems and their applications.
                  The two models are: maximizing (or minimizing) a probability
                  under constraints and programming under probabilistic
                  constraints. There are a number of variants and special cases
                  of these models and we present them in Section 1. In Section 2
                  we summarize those mathematical theories which can be used to
                  prove the convexity of large classes of our problems and we
                  also show how they can be applied in this context. In Section
                  3 we present solution algorithms of our stochastic programming
                  problems. Since we are handling probabilities of sets in
                  higher dimensional spaces, it is necessary to use bounding and
                  other approximation algorithms to find these probabilities
                  with satisfactory precision. This is the subject of Section 5.
                  In Section 4 we present two-stage and multi-stage problems
                  which are combined with probabilistic constraints. Some
                  duality and stability theorems are presented in Section 6.
                  Finally, in Section 7, we present applications of our model

abstract = {Probabilistic programs use familiar notation of programming
                  languages to specify probabilistic models. Suppose we are
                  interested in estimating the distribution or expectation of a
                  return expression r of a probabilistic program P. We are
                  interested in slicing the probabilistic program P and obtain a
                  simpler program SLI(P) which retains only those parts of P
                  that are relevant to estimating r, and elides those parts P
                  that are not relevant to estimating r. We desire that the SLI
                  transformation be both correct and efficient. By correct, we
                  mean that P and SLI(P) have identical estimates on r. By
                  efficient, we mean that estimation over SLI(P) be as small as
                  possible. We show that usual notions of program slicing, which
                  traverse control and data dependencies backward from the
                  return expression r, are unsatisfactory for probabilistic
                  programs, since it produces incorrect results on some programs
                  and inefficient results on others. Our key insight is that in
                  addition to the usual notions of control dependence and data
                  dependence that are used to slice non-probabilistic programs,
                  a new kind of dependence called observe dependence arises
                  naturally due to observe statements in probabilistic programs.
                  We propose a new definition of SLI(P) which is both correct
                  and efficient for probabilistic programs, by including observe
                  dependence in addition to control and data dependences for
                  computing slices. We prove correctness mathematically, and we
                  demonstrate efficiency empirically. We show that by applying
                  the SLI transformation as a pre-pass, we can improve the
                  efficiency of probabilistic inference, not only in our own
                  inference tool R2, but also in other systems for performing
                  inference such as Church and Infer.NET.},
